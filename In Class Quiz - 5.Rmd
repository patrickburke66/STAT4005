# Exercise 1

I believe the first graph, with `count` on the Y axis is the correct graph. I dont believe it makes sense to put the average bill length on the Y axis for a bar graph as then it is not showing the quantity of something, but rather a singular data point. For this, I believe the correct graph is the first graph.


# Exercise 2

```{r}
##install.packages("here")

hpi_df <- read_csv(here("data/hpi-tidy.csv"))

hpi_df <- hpi_df %>%
  mutate(GovernanceRank = as.integer(GovernanceRank))

hpi_graph <- hpi_df %>%
  filter(!is.na(GovernanceRank))

hpi_graph <- hpi_graph %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise(GovernanceMean = mean(GovernanceRank))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = hpi_graph, aes(x = Region, y = GovernanceMean)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
```
